# 4. K-Nearest Neighbors Method
  > The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method is a simple machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the "k" closest data points (neighbors) to a given input point in a feature space. For classification, the majority class among these neighbors determines the class of the input point. For regression, the average (or weighted average) of the neighbors' target values is used to predict the target value for the input point. KNN relies on the assumption that similar data points tend to have similar outcomes.
